# OS_p7-FileSystemValidator
 
This project was assigned as my seventh and final project of my Operating Systems course. 
The specifcation can be found linked here [link] (https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC_4730_FALL_2022/tree/main/projects/p7)

This project had us creating a program that will validate a file system's image. It will perform extensive checks on it, ensuring no corruption is found. If corruption is found, the program will output what is corrupt about it.

We were given several images, but not told which were corrupts (if at all) nor what the corruption was.
The file system was specially created by our professor based on the xv6 file system layout.
