# OS_p5-SimpleMemorySimulation

This project was the fifth project assigned in our Operating Systems course. This program was created to simulate the memory management of a computer. The program reads in a set of commands from a file, and then simulates the memory management of the computer. The program will output the results of the simulation to the standard output.

This was created as a partner project between **Jordan Ball** and **Joey Sachtleben**.
