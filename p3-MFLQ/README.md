# OS_p3-MFLQ
 
This project was assigned as my third project in my Operating Systems course.
The specification for the project can be found here [link](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC_4730_FALL_2022/tree/main/projects/p3)

This project was a continuation of the previous project, which had us building a simulated stride-based scheduler. This project instead had us building a simulated Multilevel Feedback Queue scheduler, which would run commands via a given data file. The data file would contain a list of commands, which would be run by the scheduler. The scheduler would then output the results of the commands to a file.
