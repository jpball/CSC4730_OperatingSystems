# OS_p6-HotPotatoSemaphores
 
This project was assigned as my sixth project in my Operating Systems course.
The project specifcation can be found here [link](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC_4730_FALL_2022/tree/main/projects/p6)

This project had us writing a program to simulate a multi-threaded game of Hot Potato between a variable number of players and potatoes using semaphores. This was our introduction to semaphores, and had us writing our own from scratch.
