# OS_p2-StrideScheduler
 
This project was the second assigned project in my Operating Systems course.
The specification for the assignment can be found here [link](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC_4730_FALL_2022/tree/main/projects/p2)

This project had us simulating a stride-based scheduler via input from a data file.
