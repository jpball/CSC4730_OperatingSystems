# OS_p4-FreeSpaceManagers
 
This project was the fourth project assigned in my Operating Systems course.
The specification for the project can be found here [link] (https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC_4730_FALL_2022/tree/main/projects/p4)

This project required us to write 3 free space managers, each using a different management algorithm.
These algorithms were:
- Slab
- Next Fit
- Best Fit

Each program would read in a set of commands via a data file, or straight from the command line. The program would then output results to the standard output.
